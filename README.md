# Chunk-Based JSON Parsing and GPU-Accelerated Data Aggregation and Hashing System
## What is the problem that we are aiming to solve?
- add how its relevant to real life problems
## Method proposed
- inputs, outputs and mayeb a flow chart
## Expected results
- what exacly are we gonna analyze (might have to look into how to perform roofline analysis)
- we can talk about CPU metrics focus on latency and GPU metrics focuses throughput(jobs/hr )
## Advantages of our current method over the initial way
- how is utilzing cpu and gpu helping, how is CUDA and its parallelization  helping
## Future Work
